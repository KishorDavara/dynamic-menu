Edit `dynamic-menu.json` file as per your requirement, refresh and see the menu you want\r\n\r\n## Menu based on REST service\r\nWrite a REST api on you server, which will provide the JSON required by menu.\r\nEdit `DynamicMenuFactory` in `dyanmic-menu.js` to point to REST api of your server.\r\nRefresh and see that menus are now REST api based.\r\n\r\n**Note: You must not change the JSON structure**\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- Test, Test and Test\r\n- Drop down menu as provided by bootstrap\r\n- Brand Logo\r\n- Icon based menu item\r\n\r\n## Copyright and license\r\n\r\n\tThe MIT License\r\n\r\n\tCopyright (c) 2014 Sirajuddin Choudhary\r\n\r\n\tPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\n\tof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\n\tin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\n\tto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\n\tcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\n\tfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\tThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\n\tall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\n\tTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n\tIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\n\tFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
