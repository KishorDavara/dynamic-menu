## Dynamic Menu

Dynamic Menu is powerful [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) directive for navigation built using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

## Features
- Include one angular directive and dependencies to get the Twitter Bootstrap navigation menu
- JSON file / Rest service based Navigation menu
- Menu to be highlighted is calculated from the URL (using `$location.path`)
- Menu is highlighted for deep paths as well, for ex `r1/someobject/:detailId` path will hight the `r1` (If `r1` is configured in JSON)

## Quick start

Open console/command prompt at location where you have `index.html` file of your angular app.
Clone dynamic-menu repository using following command

SSH : `git clone git@github.com:c-siraj/dynamic-menu.git dynamic-menu`

HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/c-siraj/dynamic-menu.git dynamic-menu`

### What comes in package

All the files are included in one directory, in future this may be grouped logically

```
bootstrap/
├── dynamic-menu/
│   ├── dynamic-menu.js // All things Angular
│   ├── dynamic-menu.html // Template used by directive
│   ├── dynamic-menu.css // Styles for menu
│   └── dynamic-menu.json // Sample JSON for menu
```

## Pre requisites
Your angular app must have all the required libraries available. if not present, you can use `bower` to install the same.

`angular`, `angular-resource`, `bootstrap` are required for `dynamic-menu`. `jquery` is dependency for `bootstrap`; `angular-route` will be used by your angualar app


## Usage
Include the required css and scripts in your `index.html` file of AngularJS App
```html
<head>
.....
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dynamic-menu/dynamic-menu.css" />
.....
</head>
<body ng-app="dynamicMenuApp">
	.....
	.....
	<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js"></script>
	<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
	<script src="bower_components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
	<script src="bower_components/angular-route/angular-route.js"></script>
	<script src="bower_components/angular-resource/angular-resource.js"></script>
	<script src="dynamic-menu/dynamic-menu.js"></script>
</body>
```	

Include the `navigation-bar` directive provided by Dynamic Menu
```html
<div data-ng-controller="DynamicMenuController" navigation-bar navigation-detail="navigationDetail"></div>
<div ng-view ></div>
```

**Notice that navigation-bar directive is placed out of ng-view**, hence you don't have to include this directive in every partial/view you have in your app.
*Will later upload a sample `index.html` file for reference*

Run the angular app, and you will see the menus right away. Edit `dynamic-menu.json` file as per your requirement, refresh and see the menu you want

## Menu based on REST service
Write a REST api on you server, which will provide the JSON required by menu.
Edit `DynamicMenuFactory` in `dyanmic-menu.js` to point to REST api of your server.
Refresh and see that menus are now REST api based.

**Note: You must not change the JSON structure**

## TODO
- Test, Test and Test
- Drop down menu as provided by bootstrap
- Brand Logo
- Icon based menu item
